## Potential Limitations

### Difficulty is based on clue count

Difficulty is determined by number of clues, not actual solving complexity. This can misrepresent how hard a puzzle feels.

### Uniqueness check is expensive

Backtracking ensures a single solution but has exponential worst-case time. Hard puzzles can take noticeable time to generate.

### No symmetry in puzzles

Clues are removed randomly, so puzzles lack the symmetry seen in professionally designed Sudoku.
